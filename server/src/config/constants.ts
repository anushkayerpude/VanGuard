 *   personnel       0.88 — GPS telemetry, accurate but sparse and latency-prone.
 *   log             0.80 — deterministic machine events, but prone to false trips.
 *   incident        0.72 — human-reported, highest variance and reporting bias.
 *   audio_recording 0.72 — instrumented acoustic capture, but human-labelled and
 *                          latency-prone; a hydrophone recording is trusted the
 *                          same as a field report because the EVENT it describes
