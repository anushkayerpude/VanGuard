/**
 * VANGUARD — AI synthesis contracts.
 *
 * HARD RULE enforced by `src/ai/grounding.ts`: every generated claim carries
 * `supportingEventIds`, and any ID that does not resolve to a real event in the
 * store is stripped before the payload leaves the server. A claim whose IDs are
 * all stripped is discarded entirely. This is what makes VANGUARD's AI output
 * verifiable rather than merely plausible.
