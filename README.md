VANGUARD is an AI-powered **Common Operating Picture (COP) and decision-support platform** for
defense and emergency watchstanders. It ingests five heterogeneous data streams, correlates
them across space and time, computes transparent confidence, prioritizes what matters, and
generates evidence-grounded situation briefings and ranked Courses of Action.

## ⚡ The thesis

> **The fusion engine is the product. The language model is a presentation layer.**

Most AI entries are a prompt with a UI attached — remove the API key and nothing remains.
VANGUARD inverts that. Every number an operator sees is produced by deterministic, auditable
code. The model is handed a finished analysis and asked only to phrase it.

**You can verify this in ten seconds:**

```bash
cd server && npm install && npm run smoke
```

No API key. No database. No Docker. The pipeline runs, fuses five feeds, and produces a fully
cited briefing — `provenance.engine: "deterministic"`.

---

## 🚀 Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Destroyerved/Vanguard.git
cd Vanguard
npm install
npm run dev
```

```
Command Center   http://localhost:5173
Backend REST     http://localhost:3001/api/v1
WebSocket Feed   ws://localhost:3001/stream
Health Check     http://localhost:3001/health
```

> **Zero-friction dual mode**: The command center frontend automatically detects if the backend is running. If offline, it seamlessly falls back to an in-browser simulation worker so judges and operators can test everything out-of-the-box.

**Optional** — richer briefing prose via Gemini:

```bash
cd server && cp .env.example .env      # add GEMINI_API_KEY, then restart
```

Without a key the deterministic synthesizer runs instead. Every feature stays operational.

### First things to try

```bash
# The whole picture in one call
curl localhost:3001/api/v1/situation/current

# Explainability drawer — the full confidence arithmetic for one event
curl localhost:3001/api/v1/events/<id>/correlations

# Verify the AI is not hallucinating citations
curl -X POST localhost:3001/api/v1/ai/verify

# Drive an escalation end to end
curl -X POST localhost:3001/api/v1/simulation/scenario \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"scenario":"border_spike"}'

# Cut the comms and watch confidence fall across the whole board
curl -X POST localhost:3001/api/v1/simulation/degraded \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{"enabled":true}'
```

## 🎯 The operational problem

Five systems describe the **same intrusion**, and none of them knows the others exist:

| Feed | Says |
|---|---|
| Radar | *"Contact, 23.02N 72.57E, 260 knots, no transponder"* |
| Perimeter sensors | *"IR trip, sector 4, amplitude 0.87"* |
| Patrol telemetry | *"GRIZZLY-1 reports visual contact"* |
| Weather | *"Visibility 1.8 km"* |
| Dispatch | *"Unauthorized entry, sector 4"* |

A watchstander assembles that in their head, under time pressure, while the situation develops.

**Putting it all on one screen is not the answer** — that is aggregation, and it makes the
overload worse. Fusion asks the harder question: *which of these observations are about the
same thing?*

---

## 🧠 How it works

```
5 FEEDS  →  NORMALIZE  →  ┌─ 1 DEDUPE      collapse same-source re-reports
                          │  2 CORRELATE   union-find, ΔR ≤5km ∧ ΔT ≤600s
                          │  3 CORROBORATE affinity × proximity × simultaneity
                          │  4 SCORE       reliability × recency × corroboration
                          │  5 ANOMALY     rate / kinematic / spatial z-scores
                          └─ 6 ESCALATE    idempotent rules → threat posture
                                    ↓
                     AI phrases the finished analysis
                                    ↓
                     GROUNDING GATE — enforced in code
                                    ↓
                     REST + WebSocket → Command Center
```

**The stage order is load-bearing.** Deduping *after* correlating would let duplicate
re-reports count as independent confirmation and manufacture false certainty.

### 1. Five sources, one contract

| Feed | Kind | Reliability | Poll |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Open-Meteo** | 🌍 **Live external API** | 0.95 | 120 s |
| Radar / surveillance | Persistent kinematic tracks | 0.92 | 3 s |
| Personnel telemetry | Patrol orbits + visual sightings | 0.88 | 6 s |
| Operational logs | Perimeter sensors + system events | 0.80 | 4 s |
| Field incidents | Dispatches with reporter credibility | 0.72 | 5 s |

Everything normalizes into `UnifiedEvent` v1.1 before entering the pipeline. Adding a sixth
feed touches four files and nothing downstream.

### 2. Explainable confidence

$$\text{Confidence} = \min\!\left(100,\ \text{round}(R_s \times D_t \times B_c \times 100)\right)$$

Live output from `GET /api/v1/events/:id/correlations`:

```
reliability 0.92 × recency 1.00 × corroboration 1.60 = 100%

breakdown   sourceReliability  92    dataFreshness     100
            spatialAgreement   57    temporalAgreement  93
            sourceAgreement   100

counterfactual   without corroboration:  92%
                              fusion:    +8
```

**The counterfactual is the number that matters.** It converts "we fuse sources" from a claim
into a measured quantity.

Corroboration is **capped at 1.6**, and same-source confirmation counts at only 0.35 — because
one radar reporting six times is not six confirmations.

### 3. The anti-hallucination guarantee

Prompting a model not to invent IDs is a request, not a constraint. So VANGUARD assumes it is
lying and checks:

```
1. Resolve every supportingEventId against the event store
2. STRIP    IDs that do not resolve
3. DISCARD  claims left with zero citations
4. RECOMPUTE overall confidence from survivors
```

Enforced in [`ai/grounding.ts`](server/src/ai/grounding.ts). Verify it yourself:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:3001/api/v1/ai/verify
# → { "verified": true, "totalCitations": 42, "ungroundedCitations": [] }
```

### 4. Anomaly detection runs *before* the model

Three independent z-score detectors — rate, kinematic, spatial. Asking a language model
"does this look unusual?" would replace a verifiable number with an opinion. The model is
*told* what is anomalous; it never decides.

```
kinematic z=2.98 : Speed 312kt is 3.0 sigma from the 92kt mean (sigma 93kt) across 19 contacts
spatial   z=4.57 : Isolated contact: nearest activity 11.7km away, 4.6 sigma beyond normal
```

### 5. Degradation propagates into the math

Feed health multiplies directly into the confidence formula. Cutting the comms does not paint
an amber dot — it lowers the trust weight of every feed, so **every score across the picture
falls**.

| | Before | Degraded | Restored |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mean confidence | 93% | **43%** | 92% |
| Feed reliability | 0.92 | 0.37 | 0.92 |

## 📊 Measured performance

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Fusion pass (118 events) | **2–37 ms** against a 3000 ms tick budget |
| Correlation comparisons | 803 grid-indexed vs ~7,000 naive |
| NL query (heuristic) | **0–2 ms**, no API call |
| Mean tick duration | ~56 ms (≈50× headroom) |
| Runtime dependencies | 4 (`express`, `ws`, `cors`, `dotenv`) |
| Tests | 114 passing, strict TypeScript, zero `any` |

## 🔬 Engineering honesty

Seven real bugs were found by **running** the system, not reading it. Each has a regression
test, and each is documented with its lesson in
[Master Guidelines Part IV](docs/MASTER_GUIDELINES.md).

| Bug | Root cause |
|---|---|
| Whole board turned CRITICAL in a minute | Escalation compounded from *current* severity across ticks |
| 188 events for 10 radar contacts | Every sweep minted a new event ID → false corroboration |
| 37 of 45 events escalated | Escalation keyed on *cluster* source diversity; clusters are transitive |
| Uncorroborated contacts marked CRITICAL | Promotion needed only confidence, which a fresh sensor reaches alone |
| A routine network log reached CRITICAL | Two escalation rules chained within one pass |
| Posture booted at RED | Thresholds calibrated for a far smaller picture |
| A feed empty for the first 15 s | Stochastic reporting with no seeded backlog |

## 🛠️ Commands

```bash
npm run dev         # starts both backend and tactical frontend concurrently
npm run dev:server  # run backend only (port 3001)
npm run dev:client  # run frontend only (port 5173)
npm run build       # compile backend (dist/) and bundle frontend
npm test            # 114 tests across confidence, fusion, grounding
npm run typecheck   # strict TypeScript across full stack
npm run smoke       # 15s end-to-end pipeline assertions
```

`npm run smoke` asserts what actually broke during development: no uncorroborated CRITICAL
promotions, no event escalated more than two tiers, radar tracks stable across sweeps, posture
not pinned at RED, **zero ungrounded citations**, and confidence falling under degraded comms.

**Run it before a demo.**
